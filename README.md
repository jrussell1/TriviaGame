# TriviaGame

This is a multiple choice trivia game - with one true false question. It was developed to pratice timers. I also used it as an opportunity to utilize the Giffy API (https://giphy.com/) and font insertion through CSS. The HTML used Twitter Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).

If the player selects the correct answer within 15 seconds an appropriate GIF appears.
If the player selects an incorrect answer the wrong answer GIF appears.
If the player does not select an answer the no answer selected GIF appears.
At the end of the game a tally appears and if the player has a score of 4 or above the winning GIF appears. If they score 3 or below the losing GIF appears.

There are notes throughout the JS file describing what each section does if you need any help interpreting what the code is doing.

I hope you enjoy.
